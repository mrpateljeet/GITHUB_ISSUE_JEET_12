# Tree Visualization & CO2 Estimation - Project Summary

## 1. Implementation Overview

In this project, I developed a React-based webpage to visualize the diameter, height, and geolocation of 100 Paulownia trees, with features for user interaction and CO2 estimation. The key components of the implementation include:

- **Tree Visualization**: Utilized React Leaflet to create an interactive map displaying markers for each tree. Each marker can be clicked to show detailed information (e.g., diameter, height) through pop-ups.
- **Interactivity and Animations**: Leveraged `framer-motion` to add hover and click animations, enhancing user engagement with tree markers.
- **CO2 Estimation**: Implemented a function to estimate CO2 absorption based on the diameter and height of each tree, aggregating individual values for total CO2 absorption and displaying it in the UI.
- **Responsiveness and Accessibility**: Added responsive styles and ensured accessibility by incorporating ARIA roles, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation support.

## 2. Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge 1: Displaying All 100 Trees on the Map**
  - *Problem*: Initially, only a few markers were displayed due to data issues and rendering limitations.
  - *Solution*: I validated and structured the dataset, ensuring all 100 tree entries were correctly represented. I also optimized rendering logic to handle all markers efficiently.

- **Challenge 2: Interactivity and Animations**
  - *Problem*: Achieving smooth animations and providing an engaging user experience was complex.
  - *Solution*: I integrated `framer-motion` to add animations for marker interactions, ensuring responsiveness and consistent performance. This improved the visual appeal and user feedback.

- **Challenge 3: Ensuring Code Quality and Maintainability**
  - *Problem*: As the project grew, maintaining clean and modular code became challenging.
  - *Solution*: I used React Hooks, functional components, and modularized code structure. Components like `TreeMarker` and `TreeMap` were separated for better maintainability.

## 3. Ensuring Code Quality

- **Self-Testing**: I rigorously tested each feature locally, ensuring the functionality was bug-free and responsive across different devices.
- **LLM Assistance**: Throughout the project, I used an LLM (Language Model) for:
  - Guidance on best practices for React component structure and state management.
  - Optimizing rendering logic and improving performance.
  - Troubleshooting errors efficiently and identifying potential improvements for user interaction and accessibility.

The combination of my coding expertise and LLM support enabled the delivery of a robust and high-quality solution, adhering to React best practices and project guidelines.
